 <tr><td><p class="description">Chiu Hong Bakery is situated on Mott Street between Grand and Broome Streets. Open every day of the year except  the first day of Chinese New Year,  Chiu Hong Bakery specializes in tantalizing Chinese pastries capable of converting even the staunchest nonbeliever to the rich heritage of Chinese desserts. <br><br>

Every time I reach that dark green signboard,enter the glass doors of Chiu Hong, and escape the harsh winter that this Singaporean-born student is unaccustomed to, it is like visiting a part of home. Greeted by incessant chatter in Cantonese and the scent of freshly baked barbecued pork buns wafting to my nostrils, it certainly feels like I have been teleported back home. <br><br>

Today, I sat down with my dollar cup of milk tea and one of those delectable pastries, a bo lo bao, otherwise known as a pineapple bun, and had a chat with Mr. Lee, the son of the original founder of Chiu Hong, in Cantonese. This is a translation of an excerpt of our conversation.<br><br>

---START---<br><br>

Brandon: So, Mr. Lee, how long has Chiu Hong been open?<br><br>

Lee: It was opened by my father 35 years ago, and we are one of the first few Chinese bakeries in New York City.<br><br>

Brandon: How has business been?<br><br>

Lee: Business has slowed down in the past few years. Bakeries have opened all over New York City, especially in Flushing and Brooklyn. Customers who used to come down are now more inclined to head to bakeries nearer their homes. The younger generation is also more likely to head to the "newer" cafes and Western pastry shops that have sprung up all across the city. It is difficult for a traditional bakery to survive these days.<br><br>

Brandon: I see. That is a pity, the pastries here are some of the freshest and tastiest I've had, especially in Chinatown. It will truly be a tragedy if this heritage is lost. What are some of your best-selling pastries since Chiu Hong first opened?<br><br>

Lee: Thank you for the compliment! Our mooncakes are very popular, since we only make them during the Mid-Autumn Festival and for special events. Apart from that, people love our shao bing (Red Bean Biscuit), Chinese mochi with peanut and coconut filling, and sesame balls, as well as egg tarts.<br><br>

Brandon: Wow I have not tried the shao bing before! I must give it a try another day.<br><br>

Mr Lee is right, Chiu Hong and other Chinese bakeries like it in Chinatown are facing stiffer competition from dessert shops and ice cream parlors that have taken Chinatown by storm in the past two to three years. Just next door to Chiu Hong is Milk and Cream, which serves ice cream with cereal mix ins and they are undoubtedly more popular, drawing potential customers away from bakeries like Chiu Hong. It is indeed a pity because these traditional bakeries have maintained the quality of their pastries without significant price hikes, but are getting outcompeted by more young-adult-friendly cafes despite being more than 50 percent cheaper. <br><br>

At Chiu Hong you can get a pastry and a cup of tea for $2. One would be hard-pressed to find a better deal than that in a place like Manhattan. That's not all, come after 4 p.m. and you can snag yourself an incredible deal where three buns go for just a dollar! For a university student trying to survive in New York City with its ludicrously high cost of living, being able to pick up quality pastries for just a dollar and reheating them to tide myself over on  late study nights is a blessing I cannot be more grateful for.<br><br>

Chiu Hong is one of those places that, once you've been to, you will keep coming back. Yes, there's no denying that the Chinese in me is allured by the similarities to home. I have tried numerous pastries there and brought multiple friends to share my joy and no one has ever left disappointed. The next time you're in the vicinity of Soho or Chinatown, pay Chiu Hong Bakery a visit and be assured that you will leave with no regrets.
